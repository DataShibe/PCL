# PCL
PCL is a programming language to calculate Physical calculations. PCL stands for Physics Calculation Language. I have got the Idea for the Language once in physics class, where I was bored of calculating all these forces and stuff, so I thought, that I could just write a program, that could do that for me. I then started to develop the Idea with S1 and this is the result. S1 helped me with the Alpha version, so half the credit goes to him.

# Technical Information
PCL is a very basic language in the form of a declarative language (I hope so) but there isn't a real flow-structure in the language.

Here is the Wiki article of declarative programming languages: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming

# What can the language do?
PCL can define Variables and do calculations with them. You can also declare different ratios of types, for example the type 'g' is calculated by multiplying 'm' with 'f'. You can then calculate variables with these ratios and print them out. Overriding Variables and setting variables to other variables is also included.

If you want to know more about the syntax of the language, take a look at the grammar file and the example.
